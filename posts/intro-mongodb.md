## Database Basics

#### What's a Database
A database is an organized persistant collection of structured data. You can 
picture a database as a table of rows and columns which make it easy to process
and query data. The data can be accessed, managed, modified, updated,
controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language [(SQL).](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
Below is an example of what an SQL database would look like.

#### Types of Databases
There are many different types of databases and picking the right one depends
on how your organization will use the data. We'll cover a few types here.
* **Relational Databases.** Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. 
Items in a relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns
and rows. Relational database technology provides the most efficient and 
flexible way to access structured information.
* **Object-Oriented Databases.** Information in an object-oriented database 
is represented in the form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.
* **NoSQL Databases.** A NoSQL, or nonrelational database, allows unstructured and 
semistructured data to be stored and manipulated (in contrast to a relational 
database, which defines how all data inserted into the database must be 
composed). NoSQL databases grew popular as web applications became more common 
and more complex. (MongoDB is a NoSQL Database)

#### What is CRUD
When it comes databases, we interact with them by through queries to Create,
Retrieve, Update, and Delete [(CRUD)](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud) 
data within a database.
