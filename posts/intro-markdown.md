## What is Markdown?
***
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It was created in 2004 and Markdown is one of the world's most popular markup langauges.

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. Instead of using an application to format the document such as Microsoft Word, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.  

## The Basics

### PARAGRAPHS, HEADERS, BLOCKQUOTES
***
Paragraphs are one or more consecutive lines of text seprarted by one or more blank lines. A blank line is any line that looks blank -- spaces or tabs are considered blank.

Markdown offers two styles of headers: Setext and atx. Setext-style headers for &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;h2&gt; are created by "underlining" with equal signs (=) and hyphens (-). To create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (#) at the beginning of the link.
